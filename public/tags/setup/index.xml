      <description>Initialising the databases was a little tricky to begin with - my understanding of Docker and mongo is not spectactular. However, I learned that mongo would run any .sh or .js files in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d on container startup. This seems to be the recommended way of creating your databases and inserting any initial items you would like to have at the beginning.
I started with using .js files using some tutorials found in various documentation, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to get it to work.</description>
